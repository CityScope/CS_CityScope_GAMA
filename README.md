# [CityScope](https://github.com/mitmedialab/CityScope_GAMA/wiki/CityScope)

Agent-Based Model integrated in the CityScope Volpe using the GAMA Platform. 

# [Game IT](https://github.com/mitmedialab/CityScope_GAMA/wiki/Game-IT)
An open source, multi-level agent-based model simulating real life traffic flow developed using the Gama Platform. It models agent behaviours in different vehicle type travelling through a city. It shows how the future mobility mode can change the local feel of the city. The model and the simulation output helps to see the impact of different mobility modes on traffic flow and congestion.
